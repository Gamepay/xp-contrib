How to install
==============

xpsvn can be installed by copying the contents of the src/ folder
into any directory that's listed in your PATH environment variable,
usually the directory ~/bin.
For people living on the edge, I suggest just symlinking the xpsvn
script into ~/bin - that way, you'll automatically get the updates
from the repository (including possible bugs, however!).

How it works
============
xpsvn comes with a pretty long self explanation; to read that
just invoke xpsvn without any parameters.
